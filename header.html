      <h1>What is Mercury?</h1>
      <br>
      <p class="AllText">Mercury is a naturally-occurring chemical element found in rock in the earth's crust, including
        in
        deposits of
        coal. On the periodic table, it has the symbol "Hg" and its atomic number is 80. It exists in several forms:
      </p>
      <li class="AllText ul1">Elemental (metallic) mercury</li>
      <li class="AllText ul1">Inorganic mercury compounds</li>
      <li class="AllText ul1">Methylmercury and other organic compounds</li>
      <h2>Elemental (Metallic) Mercury</h2>
      <p class="AllText">Elemental or metallic mercury is a shiny, silver-white metal, historically referred to as
        quicksilver, and is liquid at room temperature. It is used in older thermometers, fluorescent light bulbs and
        some electrical switches. When dropped, elemental mercury breaks into smaller droplets which can go through
        small cracks or become strongly attached to certain materials. At room temperature, exposed elemental mercury
        can evaporate to become an invisible, odorless toxic vapor. If heated, it is a colorless, odorless gas. <a
          href="https://www.epa.gov/mercury/how-people-are-exposed-mercury#metallicmercury" target="_self"
          class="OnThisPage"> Learn
          about how people are most often exposed to elemental mercury </a> and about the <a
          href="https://www.epa.gov/mercury/health-effects-exposures-mercury#metallic" target="_self"
          class="OnThisPage"> adverse health
          effects that
          exposures
          to elemental mercury can produce.</a></p>
      <p class="AllText">Elemental mercury is an element that has not reacted with another substance. When mercury
        reacts with another substance, it forms a compound, such as inorganic mercury salts or methylmercury.</p>
      <h2>Inorganic Mercury</h2>
      <p class="AllText">In its inorganic form, mercury occurs abundantly in the environment, primarily as the minerals
        cinnabar and metacinnabar, and as impurities in other minerals. Mercury can readily combine with chlorine,
        sulfur, and other elements, and subsequently weather to form inorganic salts. Inorganic mercury salts can be
        transported in water and occur in soil. Dust containing these salts can enter the air from mining deposits of
        ores that contain mercury. Emissions of both elemental or inorganic mercury can occur from coal-fired power
        plants, burning of municipal and medical waste, and from factories that use mercury. Inorganic mercury can also
        enter water or soil from the weathering of rocks that contain inorganic mercury salts, and from factories or
        water treatment facilities that release water contaminated with mercury.</p>
      <p class="AllText">Although the use of mercury salts in consumer products, such as medicinal products, have been
        discontinued, inorganic mercury compounds are still being widely used in skin lightening soaps and creams.
        Mercuric chloride is used in photography and as a topical antiseptic and disinfectant, wood preservative, and
        fungicide. In the past, mercurous chloride was widely used in medicinal products, including laxatives, worming
        medications, and teething powders. It has since been replaced by safer and more effective agents. Mercuric
        sulfide is used to color paints and is one of the red coloring agents used in tattoo dyes.</p>
      <p class="AllText">Human exposure to inorganic mercury salts can occur both in occupational and environmental
        settings. Occupations with higher risk of exposure to mercury and its salts include mining, electrical equipment
        manufacturing, and chemical and metal processing in which mercury is used. In the general population, exposure
        to mercuric chloride can occur through the dermal route from the use of soaps and creams or topical antiseptics
        and disinfectants. Another, less well-documented, source of exposure to inorganic mercury salts among the
        general population is from their use in ethnic religious, magical, and ritualistic practices and in herbal
        remedies.</p>
      <h2>Methylmercury</h2>
      <p class="AllText">When inorganic mercury salts can become attached to airborne particles. Rain and snow deposit
        these particles on land. Even after mercury gets deposited on land, it often returns to the atmosphere, as a gas
        or associated with particles, and then redeposits elsewhere. </p>
      <p class="AllText">As it cycles between the atmosphere, land, and water, mercury undergoes a series of complex
        chemical and physical transformations, many of which are not completely understood. Microscopic organisms can
        combine mercury with carbon, thus converting it from an inorganic to organic form. Methylmercury is the most
        common organic mercury compound found in the environment, and is highly toxic. <a

      <h1>Emissions of Mercury into the Air</h1>
      <p class="AllText">Mercury becomes a problem for the environment when it it is released from rock and ends up in
        the atmosphere and in water. These releases can happen naturally. Both volcanoes and forest fires send mercury
        into the atmosphere. </p>
      <p class="AllText">Human activities, however, are responsible for much of the mercury that is released into the
        environment. The burning of coal, oil and wood as fuel can cause mercury to become airborne, as can burning
        wastes that contain mercury. </p>
      <p class="AllText">This airborne mercury can fall to the ground in raindrops, in dust, or simply due to gravity
        (known as “air deposition”). The amount of mercury deposited in a given area depends on how much mercury is
        released from local, regional, national, and international sources.</p>
      <h2>Emissions from Power Plants</h2>
      <p class="AllText">Since mercury occurs naturally in coal and other fossil fuels, when people burn these fuels for
        energy, the mercury becomes airborne and goes into the atmosphere. In the United States, power plants that burn
        coal to create electricity are the largest source of emissions; they account for about 44 percent of all manmade
        mercury emissions <i>(Source: <a

      </ul>
      <p class="AllText">The burning of municipal and medical waste was once a major source of mercury emissions. A
        reduction in the use of mercury along with state and federal regulations, however, has led to a decrease in
        emissions from this source by over 95%.</p>

        the PDF document) and in Figure 2-4 (see page 2-30 of the PDF document).</p>
      <h2>Mercury Emissions around the Globe</h2>
      <p class="AllText">What happens to mercury after it is emitted depends on several factors:</p>
      <li class="AllText ul1">The form of mercury emitted</li>
      <li class="AllText ul1">The location of the emission source</li>
      <li class="AllText ul1">How high above the landscape the mercury is released (for example, the height of a
        power-plant stack)</li>
      <li class="AllText ul1">The surrounding terrain</li>
      <li class="AllText ul1">The weather</li>
      <p class="AllText">Depending on these factors, mercury in the atmosphere can be transported over a range of
        distances -- anywhere from a few feet from its source, to halfway around the globe -- before it is deposited in
        soil or water. Mercury that remains in the air for prolonged periods of time and travels across continents is
        said to be in the "global cycle."</p>
      <p class="AllText">One major source of mercury emissions outside of the U.S. is<a

      <h1>Common Exposures to Mercury</h1>
      <p class="AllText">The main way that people are exposed to mercury is by eating fish and shellfish that have high
        levels of methylmercury, a highly toxic form of mercury, in their tissues. A less common way people are exposed
        to mercury is breathing mercury vapor. This can happen when mercury is released from a container, or from a
        product or device that breaks. If the mercury is not immediately contained or cleaned up, it can evaporate,
        becoming an invisible, odorless, toxic vapor.</p>

      <h1>Health Effects Associated with Exposures to Mercury</h1>
      <p class="AllText">Mercury exposure at high levels can harm the brain, heart, kidneys, lungs, and immune system of
        people of all ages. High levels of methylmercury in the bloodstream of babies developing in the womb and young
        children may harm their developing nervous systems, affecting their ability to think and learn.</p>

      <h1>Ecological Effects of Mercury Exposure</h1>
      <p class="AllText">Birds and mammals that eat fish have more exposures to methylmercury than other animals in
        water ecosystems. Predators that eat these birds and mammals are also at risk. Methylmercury has been found in
        eagles, otters, and endangered Florida panthers. At high levels of exposure, methylmercury's harmful effects on
        these animals include:</p>
      <li class="AllText ul1">Death</li>
      <li class="AllText ul1">Reduced reproduction</li>
      <li class="AllText ul1">Slower growth and development</li>
      <li class="AllText ul1">Abnormal behavior</li>
